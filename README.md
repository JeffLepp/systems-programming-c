# Systems Programming Projects (C)

This directory contains multiple standalone systems programming projects written
in C. Each subdirectory is an independent project with its own build and run
instructions. Written during Fall of 2025.

The projects focus on core operating systems and networking concepts, including:
- Filesystem data structures
- CPU cache simulation
- Process scheduling
- Linux kernel modules
- HTTP proxying with sockets

All projects were developed and tested on Linux. Each project directory includes
a README describing what it does and how to build and run it.
